Good evening everyone.
Today I'm going to talk about my self-study project on Azure.

My name is Kyohei Mizumoto.
I'm a software engineer who mainly uses C#, and currently studying kubernetes. 

I don't use kubernetes for work.
So in order deepen my understanding and to test out the features of kubernetes,
I tried to make a project on Azure.

I chose Microsoft Azure just because I have some free credit.
AS an application running on the cluster, I chose mattermost.
It's a chat application like slack. 

This is the configuration of my project.
I added monitoring, logging, tls support, and secret data management.

All Azure services but Database are managed with terraform.
And of course, kubernetes resources are manifest files.
So I can recreate the environment of my project easily.

However, there are some problems that I came across.
Azure Key Vault doesn't support mounting as an environment variable.
Besides, secrets on Azure Key Vault are now inaccessible from outside the cluster.
I don't know why for now.

And it's not a problem, but I've not set metrics of prometheus and fluent bit properly.

I have to deploy some kubernetes resources in turn.

To expand my project, I want to try to add continuous delivery and service mesh.

Source code is published on GitHub.
And you can try the mattermost on my project.

Thank you for listnening.
