Today I'm going to talk about the cluster management on Azure.

My name is Kyohei Mizumoto.
I'm a software engineer using C#

I'm studying kubernetes, but I don't use it for work.
I wanted to test out the features of kubernetes, so I made the study project on Azure.

I chose Microsoft Azure because I have some free credit.

This is the configuration of my project.
I combined Azure managed services and kubernetes resources.
