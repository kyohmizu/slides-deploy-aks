Today I'm going to talk about the cluster management on Azure.

My name is Kyohei Mizumoto.
I'm a software engineer using C#

I'm studying kubernetes, but I don't use it for work.
I wanted to test out the features of kubernetes, so I made the study project on Azure.

I chose Microsoft Azure because I have some free credit.

This is the configuration of my project.
I added monitoring, logging, tls support, and secret data management.

Now there are some problems.
Azure Key Vault doesn't support mounting as environment variables.
And now I can't see secrets on Azure Key Vault from outside.

And metrics of prometheus and fluent bit are not enough.

Next I want to add continuous delivery and service mesh.

Thank you for listnening.
